I am a PhD Student at Tecnico Lisboa and KTH, as a part of Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate in Distributed Computer program ( EMJD-DC).  I work  under the supervision of Prof. Paolo Romano at INESC-ID and Prof. Vladimir Vlassov at KTH.

My main research interests are in algorithms for concurrent systems, either on single machine or distributed environments. At the moment my research is focused on enhancing efficiency and dependability of transactional memory systems in terms of both performance and energy.

During my Masters, I worked on computing infrastructure for bioinformatics under supervision of Prof. Mohamed Abouelhoda. My work was on development of bioinformatics workflows management system with high performance and cloud computing support.
